      <ol>
        <li>
          Fill small pots or seed trays with compost. Use a watering can fitted
          with a fine rose to thoroughly wet the compost, and leave to drain.
        </li>

        <li>
          Sprinkle seeds evenly and thinly over the surface of the compost,
          leaving approx 2cm – 3cm between each one, if possible. Cover seeds
          with a thin layer of compost, about the same depth as the size of the
          seed (the smaller the seed, the thinner the layer of compost).
        </li>

        <li>
          Cover the pot with a clear polythene bag or piece of glass or clear
          plastic, to maintain an even temperature for germination, and keep the
          compost moist. Place the pot of seeds on a well-lit windowsill or in a
          heated propagator.
        </li>

        <li>
          Remove the plastic or glass cover as soon as the seeds have germinated
          and you can see the seedlings growing out of the compost. Grow them on
          in a warm place indoors – if growing them on a windowsill you may need
          to move them at night as temperatures can drop dramatically. The young
          plants will ready to be ‘pricked’ out when the second pair of leaves,
          known as ‘true’ leaves, emerge.
        </li>

        <li>
          When pricking out seedlings, handle them only by their leaves, not the
          stem. Fill a seed tray with compost and plant seedlings about 5cm
          apart, burying the seedling up to the base of the first set of leaves.
        </li>

        <li>
          After a couple of weeks, the young plants will be large enough to pot
          individually into 7.5cm pots, or planted outside in well-prepared
          soil. Handle plants gently, firm compost around them and water well.
          Don’t allow the soil or compost to dry out.
        </li>

        <li>
          Now you can harvest your treasures and amaze your household members
          with the most delicious, organic and fresh vegetables!
